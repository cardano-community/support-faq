The following is a list of well-known wallets to support Cardano.

Note that in case of issues, usually only queries relating to official wallets can be answered in Cardano groups across telegram/forum. You may need to consult with specific wallet support teams for third party wallets.

!> Its is important to know whether your wallet keys are owned by you (not shared without your knowledge), and that the keys used can be restored in official wallets
