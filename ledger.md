'Ledger' is a range of cryptocurrency hardware wallets sold by France-based Ledger SAS.
Products in this range provide a physical solution for storing cryptocurrency assets, including ada, in a secure and convenient manner.
Like a mobile phone or PC, Ledger hardware wallets also require software components in order to function.

These software components include:  
  
**Ledger Live** - Management software used for viewing cryptocurrency assets, installing / uninstalling apps and managing the device.  
**Firmware** - This is the low-level software that is installed on the device.  
**Apps** - Apps are installed on the device and provide additional functionality, such as storing cryptocurrency assets and cryptographic keys.
