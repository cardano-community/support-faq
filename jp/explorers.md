##### What is an Explorer?

An explorer is a web based graphical tool, used to search for and view information stored on the blockchain ledger.  

When users interact with the Cardano network, whether that is by sending and receiving ada or delegating to a stake pool, these interactions are broadcast to the network in the form of transactions. A block producing node takes a number of these transactions, verifies their validity and then adds them to the tip of the chain in a new block.  

Blockchain explorers allow users to query based on various aspects - blocks, transactions, addresses , and with the transition to shelley era - stake pool information. They present this data in a format that is human readable and accessible using a web browser.  

Some explorers provide additional tools and information, such as API support, a list of the largest addresses by ADA balance, graphical visualisations of the blockchain's network activity, stakepool distributions, etc.
